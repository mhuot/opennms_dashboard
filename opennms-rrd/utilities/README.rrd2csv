This is a simple tool to create CSV files from RRD archives.

Note that it requires that rrdtool be in your path, and that
you have the XML::SAX module installed, as well as
Text::CSV_XS (preferred) or Text::CSV_PP.

Usage:

  ./rrd2csv <rrd_file> [output_file]

If the output file is not specified, it will write to the
console.

If you give the output file the extension ".xls" you will be
able to automatically import it into Excel.
