	<para>
	Clicking on the "Search" link in the main menu takes us to the search page.  
	From here we can search for nodes using various criteria.  Once a search is 
	initiated we recieve a list of nodes and their interfaces that match 
	the search criteria.  Each of these will be a link to the main node, or interface 
	pages.  These pages contain a very complete set of information about each 
	device.  Below is more detail on some of the different types of searches 
	that can be done.

		<title>Searching for Nodes</title>
		<para>
		Generate lists of nodes that match any of a number of criteria 
		including ip addresses, services, and machine names.  Ranges of addresses 
		can be entered for example, to provide a list of nodes that have ip 
		addresses in that range.  There are examples on this page, as well as 
		some syntax rules to help refine searches.  If all else fails 
		there is also a link to "list all nodes"
