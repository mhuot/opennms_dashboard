			OpenNMS is a complex software product, and it does not (yet) have a
			simple "<code>./configure &amp;&amp; make &amp;&amp; make install</code>"
			build process like many other tools. If there is a packaged release for
			your operating system, we highly suggest you use that instead. If you have
			problems with a packaged release, please see the troubleshooting section
			for assistance.
