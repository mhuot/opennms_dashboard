##### NOTE #####
# As of OpenNMS 1.3.8, the only configuration that *must* be in this file is
# to set opennms.home to be able to find $OPENNMS_HOME/etc/opennms.properties;
# all configuration happens in there instead.
# eventually this will be done totally differently, but lets us handle tomcat and
# jetty sanely, at least.  HOWEVER, if you do put something in here, it will
# override opennms.properties, so be careful!

opennms.home=${install.dir}/

###### TROUBLE TICKETING ######
# Set this property to enable the creating of trouble tickets from the alarm details page.
# In order to set this a trouble ticketing plugin must be configured in the opennms daemon.
#
# The default value is false (ie trouble tickets cannot be created via the alarm details page)
# opennms.alarmTroubleTicketEnabled = false

# Example for templating an HTML reference with the ticket ID 
# This is an example for use with the CentricCRM Plugin
#opennms.alarmTroubleTicketLinkTemplate = <a href="http://localhost:8080/centric/TroubleTickets.do?command=Details&id=${id}">${id}</a>

###### RTC IPC ######
# The base of a URL that RTC clients use when creating a RTC subscription URL.
# If you are using Tomcat instead of the built-in Jetty, you will probably need to change the port.
opennms.rtc-client.http-post.base-url = http://localhost:8080/opennms/rtc/post

# The username the RTC uses when authenticating itself in an HTTP POST.
opennms.rtc-client.http-post.username = rtc

# The password the RTC uses when authenticating itself in an HTTP POST.
opennms.rtc-client.http-post.password = rtc

###### MAP IPC ######
# The base of a URL that Map System clients use when creating a Map subscription URL.
# If you are using Tomcat instead of the built-in Jetty, you will probably need to change the port.
opennms.map-client.http-post.url = http://localhost:8080/opennms/map/post

# The username the Map System uses when authenticating itself in an HTTP POST.
opennms.map-client.http-post.username = map

# The password the Map System uses when authenticating itself in an HTTP POST.
opennms.map-client.http-post.password = map
