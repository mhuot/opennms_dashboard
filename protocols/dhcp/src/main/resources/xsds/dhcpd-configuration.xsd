          <documentation>IP address used as the relay IP address in DHCP

          DHCP poller in "relay" mode instead of the default "broadcast" mode.
          In "relay" mode, the DHCP server being polled will unicast its
          responses directly back to the specified ip address rather than
          broadcasting its responses. This allows DHCP servers to be polled
          even though they are not on the same subnet as the OpenNMS server,
          and without the aid of an external relay. This is usually set to the
          IP address of the OpenNMS server.</documentation>

          <documentation>Set extended DHCP polling mode. When extendedMode is
          false (the default), the DHCP poller will send a DISCOVER and expect
          an OFFER in return. When extendedMode is true, the DHCP poller will
          first send a DISCOVER. If no valid response is received it will send
          an INFORM. If no valid response is received it will then send a
          REQUEST. OFFER, ACK, and NAK are all considered valid responses in
          extendedMode. Caution on usage: If in extended mode, the time
          required to complete the poll for an unresponsive node is increased
          by a factor of 3. Thus it is a good idea to limit the number of
          retries to a small number.</documentation>

          <documentation>Set the IP address to be requested in DHCP REQUEST
          queries. This attribute is only used when the extendedMode attribute
          is set to "true". If an IP address is specified, it will be
          requested in the query. If the string "targetHost" is specified, the
          DHCP server's own ip address will be requested. Since a well-managed
          server will probably not respond to a request for its own IP
          address, this parameter can also be set to the string
          "targetSubnet". This is similar to "targetHost", except the last
          octet of the DHCP server's IP address is incremented or decremented
          by 1 to obtain an IP address that is on the same subnet. The
          resulting address will not be on the same subnet if the DHCP
          server's subnet length is 31 or 32. Otherwise, the algorithm used
          should be reliable.</documentation>
