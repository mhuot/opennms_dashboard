Once the packages are installed, you will need to do the following:

Set some environment variables:

export JAVA_HOME=/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.0_02 (or whatever your Java home dir is)

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib:/usr/local/ssl/lib/:/usr/local/pgsql/lib:/usr/local/opennms/lib:/usr/local/pgsql/include/server/lib:/usr/local/pgsql/include/internal/lib

export POSTGRES_LIB=/usr/local/pgsql/lib

export PERL5LIB=/usr/local/lib/perl5

Create a database:

sudo -u postgres ./initdb -D /usr/local/pgsql/data -E ""

Next, start up Postgres:

sudo -u postgres ./pg_ctl -D /usr/local/pgsql/data/ start (or run it as the postgres user if you don't use sudo)

Then, set up the database structure:

/usr/local/opennms/bin/install.pl -q /usr/local/opennms/etc/create.sql

Once this completes successfully, you are ready to start OpenNMS:

/usr/local/opennms/bin/opennms.sh start

and then tomcat:

/usr/local/tomcat/bin/startup.sh

Note: The shell you start this in will behave like a console, and you may get some JMX messages like:

DEBUG:  pq_recvbuf: unexpected EOF on client connection

Just ignore them.
