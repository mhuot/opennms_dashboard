To do:

X -Start time
X -End time
X -Total time
X -Total number of services
X-Total number of threads
X -Average time of collection per service
X -Number of collections per service
X -Total collection time per service
X -Read log messages from a file
X-Adding more than one log resets start time
X -End log messages should not set start time
X -Start log messages should not set end time
X-Should the count of collections count errors - yes
X-Separate errors from successful in collection attempts 
 X-Output Global stats
 X-Output service stats heading
 X-Output stats for a single service
 X -Output entire report
-Close log file in finally
X-Add persist time stats
X -Sort service stats
	X -Sort by average collection time (2 days)
		X -Write custom comparator
		X -Create enum value to use as a flag
		X -pass enum to comparator method
		X -Sort collection using custom comparator
		X -Create method to set enum flag
	X -Sort by total collection time (1 day)
	X -Sort by average time between collections (half a day for the rest)
	X -Sort by successful collections
	X -Sort by successful percentage
	X -Sort by unsuccessful collections
	X -Sort by unsuccessful percentage
	X -Sort by total collections
	X -Sort by total persist time
	X -Sort by service name
X -Reverse sorting of service stats (1 day)
	X -Create enum value to use as a flag
	X -Create method to set enum
	(implementation changed) -create method to reverse previously sorted list
	X -Pass enum to comparator 
	X -Reverse the sort order of a comparator
X -Parse command line parameters (2 days) 
	X -check each args[] value for predetermined flags
	X -parse each value when if/when it matches any of the previously decided upon flags
-output sorted service stats
-Add Filtering (I am going to have to figure this one out...) (3 days)
	-Filter by service
 	-Filter by greater than (webapp)
 	-Filter by less than (webapp)
 -Add reverse filtering "all but this." (Figuring out filtering should help with this one) (1 day)
 
 
 -Go back and make method names consistent (specifically error/unsuccessful collection methods) (a few hours)
 -Rename methods to be more informative (a few hours)
 -Refactor. 
  
   Total estimated time: 10.5 days.
   Current time spent: 3 days
   Total estimated work left: 4 days
